# Demo - Branch Prediction

## Overview

A demonstration of the utility of branch prediction.

This demo consists of two almost identical assembly programs, `predictable.s` and `unpredictable.s`. Each program generates a sequence of integers, and for each integer, performs a slightly different operation depending if it's even or odd.  
However, `unpredictable`'s sequence is largely random, while `predictable`'s sequence alternates perfectly between even and odd.

## Requirements

- GCC
- Make

## Build & Run

To build both programs, run in this directory:

```bash
make
```

Then run each program and check their performance:

```bash
time ./predictable
time ./unpredictable
```

You may want to confirm the branch prediction hit rate:

```bash
perf stat -e branches,branch-misses ./predictable
perf stat -e branches,branch-misses ./unpredictable
```

## Explanation

You should find that `predictable.s` runs significantly faster than `unpredictable.s` (about 50% faster on the machines I have tested).

The reason is branch prediction. Modern CPUs try to guess the result of a comparison + conditional jump (branch) to avoid stalling their instruction pipeline on waiting for the compare. If the guess is correct, the speedup can be significant; however, if the guess is wrong, the CPU must "go back" and redo execution on the correct instruction path.

If the result of the comparison is essentially random - as is the case in `unpredictable.s` - the CPU cannot do much better than 50% prediction accuracy.  
On the other hand, if the comparison result follows a pattern that the CPU can recognise - as is the case in `predictable.s` - the prediction rate can be near 100%.
