# CPU Optimisation Demonstrations

A collection of microbenchmarks demonstrating the performance optimisation features present on modern x86 CPUs.

Please note: naturally, the exact results of these microbenchmarks depend significantly on your CPU's microarchitecture. The demonstrations were written and tested with "modern" Intel x86-64 CPUs in mind, with "modern" being roughly Skylake or newer. Many of the more general demonstrations will likely work on modern AMD x86-64 CPUs as well.  
I have tried to indicate in each demonstration broadly which CPUs are supported, however this may not be completely accurate.
